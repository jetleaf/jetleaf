/// Jetleaf HTTP sub-library
///
/// This sub-library defines the **HTTP model and metadata abstractions**
/// used throughout the `jetleaf_web` package.
///
/// Importing `package:jetleaf_web/http.dart` provides types for working
/// with HTTP messages, headers, methods, status codes, cookies,
/// sessions, caching directives, ranges, entity tags, and media types.
///
/// These APIs are shared by both server- and client-side components
/// and are independent of any specific transport or runtime.
