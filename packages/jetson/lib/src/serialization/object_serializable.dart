/// {@template json_serializable}
/// Marker interface for all Jetson object (de)serialization components.
///
/// This interface has no methods and exists solely to provide a common
/// supertype for Jetson’s serialization infrastructure. Implementing
/// [ObjectSerializable] indicates that a class participates in Jetson’s
/// serialization pipeline and may be discovered, registered, or applied by:
///
/// - [ObjectSerializer]  
/// - [ObjectDeserializer]  
/// - Converter adapters  
/// - [SerializationContext] / [DeserializationContext]  
/// - Reflection-based or generated serializer lookup
///
/// ### Purpose
/// `Serializable` is used strictly as a semantic marker:
/// - It unifies all Jetson serialization components under a shared type  
/// - It assists the framework in identifying serializable/deserializable
///   handlers during runtime or code generation  
/// - It enables annotation-based discovery and automatic registration
///
/// ### Notes
/// - This interface introduces **zero runtime overhead**  
/// - It does **not** imply that a class is directly serializable as a
///   user-facing model—only that it participates in Jetson’s internal
///   serialization system  
/// - Domain model classes may choose to implement this marker, but it is
///   primarily intended for framework-level components
///
/// {@endtemplate}

  /// {@macro json_serializable}
