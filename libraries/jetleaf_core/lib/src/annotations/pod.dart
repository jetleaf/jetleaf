/// {@template pod}
/// Marks a method as a **pod provider**, enabling it to participate in the
/// dependency injection (DI) lifecycle of the application.
///
/// The method annotated with `@Pod` should return an instance of a component,
/// service, or configuration object. This returned value is automatically
/// registered in the application’s DI container and, by default, managed
/// as a **singleton**.
///
/// ---
///
/// ## 🔧 How It Works:
/// - The enclosing class is typically annotated with `@Configuration` or `@AutoConfiguration`.
/// - During application startup, all methods annotated with `@Pod` are executed,
///   and their return values are registered in the application context.
/// - These pods are then available for **injection into other classes** via
///   constructor injection, factory injection, or field injection (depending on the framework).
///
/// ---
///
/// ## 📌 Features:
/// - Default lifecycle is **singleton** (created once and reused).
/// - Supports **lazy initialization** depending on the framework’s DI engine.
/// - May support pod naming or conditional creation in extended versions.
///
/// ---
///
/// ## 🧪 Example:
/// ```dart
/// @Configuration()
/// class AppConfig {
///
///   @Pod()
///   Logger createLogger() {
///     return Logger('AppLogger');
///   }
///
///   @Pod()
///   HttpClient httpClient(Logger logger) {
///     return HttpClient(logger: logger);
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In the example above:
/// - `createLogger()` returns a `Logger` instance registered as a pod.
/// - `httpClient()` depends on `Logger`, which is automatically injected by the container.
///
/// ---
///
/// ## 🔄 Pod Lifecycle (Simplified):
/// ```text
/// - Framework initializes configuration class
/// - All @Pod methods are executed
/// - Results are cached as singleton pods
/// - Pods are injected into constructors or other pods as needed
/// ```
///
/// ---
///
/// ## 🔥 Advanced Use Cases (Possible Extensions):
/// - Conditional pods: `@ConditionalOnMissingPod`, `@Profile('dev')`
/// - Scoped pods: e.g., per request, per session (via `@Scope`)
/// - Named pods: `@Pod(name: 'myLogger')`
///
/// These can be added through optional parameters or decorators in future.
///
/// ---
///
/// ## ❗ Constraints:
/// - The method must be **non-private**.
/// - The method must **return a value**; `void` is not allowed.
/// - Must be defined within a class marked with `@Configuration`, `@AutoConfiguration`, etc.
/// - Cyclic dependencies must be handled explicitly or avoided.
///
/// ---
///
/// ## ✅ Usage Recommendations:
/// - Prefer pod methods over manual instantiation in app code.
/// - Keep logic inside pod methods minimal — do initialization but not business logic.
/// - Group related pods in separate configuration classes for clarity.
///
/// ---
///
/// ## 🧱 Related Annotations:
/// - `@Configuration` – Marks the containing class as a source of pod definitions.
/// - `@AutoConfiguration` – Similar but auto-discovered.
/// - `@Aspect` – Used for cross-cutting concerns.
/// - `@Inject`, `@Autowired` – For consuming/injecting defined pods.
///
/// ---
///
/// ## 🎯 Target:
/// Can only be applied to methods:
/// ```dart
/// @Pod()
/// MyService myService() => MyService();
/// ```
///
/// ---
/// Pod annotation for pod definition methods
/// 
/// This annotation marks a method as a pod producer.
/// 
/// Example Usage:
/// ```dart
/// @Configuration()
/// class DatabaseConfig {
///   @Pod()
///   @Scope('singleton')
///   DatabaseConnection primaryDatabase() {
///     return DatabaseConnection(
///       url: 'postgresql://localhost:5432/primary',
///       maxConnections: 20,
///     );
///   }
///   
///   @Pod('readOnlyDatabase')
///   @Scope('prototype')
///   DatabaseConnection readOnlyDatabase() {
///     return DatabaseConnection(
///       url: 'postgresql://localhost:5432/readonly',
///       readOnly: true,
///     );
///   }
/// }
